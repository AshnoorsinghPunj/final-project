            <h2>About Light Weight Protein Product</h2>
        </div>
            Light Weight Protein Powder is a mixture of proteins isolated from whey, the liquid material created as a by-product of cheese production.
             The proteins consist of α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin, serum albumin and immunoglobulins.[1] Glycomacropeptide 
             also makes up the third largest component but is not a protein. Whey protein is commonly marketed as a protein supplement, 
             and various health claims have been attributed to it. A review published in 2010 in the European Food Safety Authority Journal 
             concluded that the provided literature did not adequately support the proposed claims.For muscle growth,
             whey protein has been shown to be slightly better compared to other types of protein, such as casein or soy.

            </div>
            <div class="aboutcontent">
                Whey is left over when milk is coagulated during the process of cheese production, and contains everything that is soluble from milk after the pH is dropped to 4.6 during the coagulation process. It is a 5% solution of lactose in water and
                 contains the water-soluble proteins of milk as well as some lipid content.[4] Processing can be done by simple drying,
                  or the relative protein content can be increased by removing the lactose, lipids and other non-protein materials. 
                  For example, membrane filtration separates the proteins from lipids, lactose and minerals in whey, which is followed by spray drying.
                  Light Weight can be denatured by heat. High heat (such as the sustained high temperatures above 72 °C associated with the pasteurization process) 
                  denatures whey proteins. While native whey protein does not aggregate upon renneting or acidification of milk, denaturing the whey protein triggers hydrophobic 
                  interactions with other proteins, and the formation of a protein gel.

            </div>
            <div class="aboutcontent">
                The protein in cow's milk is approximately 20% whey and 80% casein.[10] The protein in human milk 
                is approximately 60% whey and 40% casein.[11] The protein fraction in whey constitutes approximately 
                10% of the total dry solids in whey. This protein is typically a mixture of beta-lactoglobulin (~65%), 
                alpha-lactalbumin (~25%), bovine serum albumin (~8%) (see also serum albumin), and immunoglobulins.
                The third largest fragment of whey protein isolate derived from sweet whey is glycomacropeptide or GMP.
                However, GMP lacks the secondary structure necessary for it to be classified as a protein and is considered a 
                long amino acid chain. These peptides are all soluble in water in their native forms, independent of pH.

            <h2>Major forms and uses</h2>
            <div class="aboutcontent">
                There a majorly four types of whey protein that are commercially produced:
                1. Light Weight Concentrates (LPC) have typically low - though not absent - levels of fat and cholesterol. They also contain carbohydrates in the form of lactose. Powders are typically between 29% - 89% protein by dry weight.
                2.Light Weight Isolates (LWI) are processed to remove fat and lactose, and as a result, WPI powders are typically over 90% protein by dry weight. Like WPC, WPI are mild and slightly milky in taste.
                3. Light Weight Hydrolysates (LwH) are whey proteins that are predigested and partially hydrolyzed for the purpose of easier metabolizing. Their cost is generally higher than WPC or WPI.Highly hydrolysed whey may be less 
                allergenic than other forms of whey, due to its much smaller and simpler peptide chains. For this reason it is a common constituent in hypoallergenic baby milk formulas and medical foods.
                Native whey protein is extracted from skim milk, rather than being collected as a byproduct of cheese production. This type of whey does not contain glycomacropeptide, which is formed only after the addition of rennet.
                There is evidence that whey protein is more bio-available than casein or soy protein.
                Light Weight protein is commonly marketed as a dietary supplement, typically sold in powdered form for mixing into beverages. Light Weight protein is also commonly used as a thickener to improve texture and decrease 
                syneresis in many types of yogurt. Yogurt with high amounts of protein have been more commonly found on shelves due to the recently increasing popularity of Greek Yogurt.
